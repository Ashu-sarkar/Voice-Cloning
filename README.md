# Voice-Cloning

Voice Cloning Project
Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a Voice Cloning project. The goal of this project is to collect voice data, perform data cleaning, extract voice features using the librosa library, and utilize Tacotron 2 for further processing. The project also includes feature extraction methods using TensorFlow and utilizes WaveGlow, a flow-based generative model, for audio generation.

Voice Cloning is a fascinating field with applications in speech synthesis, voice assistants, and more. This project aims to demonstrate the process of voice cloning using a combination of tools and libraries, including Librosa, TensorFlow, Tacotron 2, and WaveGlow.

In the data directory, you can store your raw audio data. You can collect voice samples in any format suitable for your project. You might consider organizing the data by speaker for easier management.

Data Cleaning
Before processing the data, it's essential to clean it. You can use the provided data_cleaning.py script or create custom cleaning processes tailored to your data. Ensure that the cleaned data is saved in the data/cleaned_audio directory.

Voice Feature Extraction
Voice feature extraction is a crucial step for voice cloning. You can use the feature_extraction.py script to extract relevant features from the cleaned audio data. Customize the feature extraction methods according to your project requirements.

Tacotron 2
Tacotron 2 is a deep learning model for speech synthesis. Implement Tacotron 2 using the provided tacotron2.py script. You can fine-tune the model on your voice data if necessary and save the trained model checkpoints in the models directory.

WaveGlow
WaveGlow is a flow-based generative model for audio generation. Use the waveglow.py script to implement WaveGlow. You can fine-tune the model and save the trained checkpoints in the models directory.
